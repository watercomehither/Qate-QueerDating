# Qate-QueerDating

Qate is a queer dating app, for us, by us. 
It uses the same end-to-end-encryption as in Signal.
It focuses on safety features to prevent harassment and stalking. These include blocking, offline browsing, disguising app icon as another app, expiring photos, and secure encryption.
